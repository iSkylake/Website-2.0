# Website-2.0

Live: https://www.llorch.com

This is my new website, trying to make it single web page and more stylish than the last one (called Portfolio).

Things to do:
- Do blog section
- ~~Add skrollable for parallax scrolling~~
- Circular graph with 0 - 100% in technologies
- ~~Hover animation to show information in my projects~~
- Move website to React
- Mobile friendly
